### Abstract
With the wide availability of the internet and the rise of e-commerce, many people have turned towards online shopping. And the likes of Amazon, Google shopping, Walmart, eBay have made online shopping a breeze. People are preferring to shop on these websites for almost all their needs especially for apparel shopping because of the wide range of options available and comparably cheaper prices. So as part of our project we have built a recommender system for apparel recommendation based on the user searches and also based on the images of the products which will help the user to make better purchases.
